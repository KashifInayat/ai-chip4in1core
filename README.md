This chip I designed with my mentee Taehyunh Kim (https://github.com/thkim2031), following each design we designed from scratch:

1) CLA
2) BFLOAT-FMA (Bfloat-Multiplication, Single Precision Accmulation)
3) 2x2 Output Stationary Systolic Array Based ML Accelerator
4) 8 bit Signed Booth-Radix8 Multiplier
